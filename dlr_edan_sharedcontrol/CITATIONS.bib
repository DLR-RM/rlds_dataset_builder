	abstract = {Light-weight robotic manipulators can nowadays be used to restore the manipulation capability of people with motor disability. However, manipulating the environment poses a complex task, especially when the control interface is of low bandwidth, as may be the case for users with impairments. Therefore, we propose a constraint-based shared control scheme which provides support in task execution. This is achieved by representing tasks as a sequence of states, with speciﬁc user command mappings and different sets of constraints being applied in each state. In our concept, new tasks can be deﬁned based on different types of constraints and conditions for state transition in a human readable manner. We provide details on the functionality and implementation of our concept and demonstrate its versatility in a pilot experiment with three activities of daily living. Results show that even complex, highdimensional tasks can be performed with a low-dimensional interface using our shared control approach.},
